##Stretch Goals##
  * Implement a timer so that the player answers the questions quickly
  * After a user submits a new Question. This question gets sent to the moderator of the game(admin) that can then review and accept or decline the question from being added to the main question pool. I would also like to add a flag in the bottom left corner if the player is certain the answer needs improvement or is actually incorrect. This question will then be passed into a “flag” array to be evaluated by the moderator again. Otherwise the question will be apart of that individual's question pool.
  * Add animation for a correct answer
  * Logic to add question form to avoid mistakes
  * User login through Github/ Facebook/ Twitter/ and or LinkedIn
  * Chat room and or Real time score updates from classmates
  * Charts to visualize progress in certain categories of the game.
  * Refactor into Angular
  * Make the trivia game customizable.

##Additional Technologies to include with Stretch Goals:##
  * Real-time transmission protocols (WebSockets, socket.io, etc)
  * One of JS visualization library (D3, Processing.js, Datatables, HighCharts, etc)
  * Testing with Jasmine/ Mocha Chai etc.
  * AngularJS
