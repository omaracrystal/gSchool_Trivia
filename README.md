##gSchool Trivia##

####Description:####
**gSchool Trivia**

This game will have the following:
* Spinner = 6 categories (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, git, General, Any)
* Question Contributor Form = this form will allow anyone to contibute to the pool of questions.
* Trivia Question Form = once the spinner stops on a category- A question associated with that category will appear with 3 choices.
* Score Card = this card will keep track on how many questions have been answered correctly and incorrectly. You will earn a point for every correct answer and lose a point for every incorrect answer

####Technologies planning to use:####

 * HTML
 * CSS
 * JavaScript / jQuery
 * Jasmine


####Stretch Goals####
* Implement a timer so that the player answers the questions quickly
* Add animation for a correct answer
* I would like to add a flag in the bottom left corner if the player is certain the answer needs improvement or is actually incorrect. This question will then be passed into a “flag” array to be evaluated by the mediator again.
* Add storage for questions generated by the add question form
* Add user Login capabilities
